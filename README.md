ðŸ”” NOTIFICATION
This branch contains the containerized versions of the projects. If you want the uncontainerized ones, please check the master branch.
This repository holds the code for my Docker Handbook article on freeCodecamp. In the article the readers work through six projects with increasing complexity. These projects are as follows:

custom-node - A custom node image based on the official ubuntu image.
custom-bash - A custom bash image based on the official alpine image.
express-api - A single container Express API.
vite-counter - A single container Vue application.
notes-api - A multi container Express API.
fullstack-notes-application - A full-stack CRUD application with nginx as a reverse proxy.
Prerequisites
Familiarity with the Linux Terminal.
Familiarity with JavaScript (some of the later projects use JavaScript).
It's fine if you haven't worked with JavaScript that much. Having a basic knowledge of executing scripts with npm will suffice.
